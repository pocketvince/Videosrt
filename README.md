videosrt is a shell script that extracts subtitles from a video file (or YouTube video) and reinserts them as hard-coded, larger, yellow subtitles on a black background.

## Update
20230408: Cleaner code, now allowing the addition of subtitles in formats other than SRT, and some lines of yt-dlp code have been added to extract subtitles from YouTube videos as well. 

## Installation
Install ffmpeg & yt-dlp
```shell
apt-get install ffmpeg yt-dlp -y
```
Download the script and place it in /bin/videosrt
