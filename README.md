# Videosrt

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pocketvince/videosrt/main/4-f2ef19ccf7.gif?raw=true "convert-st, convert, convert-ov")

Videosrt is a shell script that extracts subtitles from a video file (or YouTube video) and reinserts them as hard-coded, larger, yellow subtitles on a black background.

## Update
20230408: Cleaner code, now allowing the addition of subtitles in formats other than SRT, and some lines of yt-dlp code have been added to extract subtitles from YouTube videos as well. 

20230409: Added two features:

â€¢ Convert-OV: Blur the original video, and superpose at maximum height the same video reduced by 25% and include the subtitles (as on the "convert" command)

â€¢ Convert-ST: Incorporates subtitles to the video and keeping standard size and color

## Installation
Install ffmpeg & yt-dlp
```shell
apt-get install ffmpeg yt-dlp -y
```
Download the script and place it in /bin/videosrt
